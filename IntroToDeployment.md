This content will be initially taught via an article, and then reinforced by an off platform project?

If they don't know git we can't really teach deploying. Maybe keep it on platform?

Standard: Learners will understand what is happening when they run their apps locally. 
Standard: Learners will understand what it means to deploy an app on a physical server.
Standard: Learners will understand the benefits of using cloud servers.
    Explanation:
    Running a server locally! Your computer is talking to itself via ports.
    Having one server! But what if itâ€™s far far away! Maybe your server is in Greenland and your user is in China! Requests have to physically travel there through fiber optic cables that are necessarily slower than the speed of light.
    Having servers everywhere! But this is expensive!
    Having cloud servers!
